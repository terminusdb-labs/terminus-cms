The first 9,999 of this set produced were sold in packaging identifying the set as a ""Limited Edition"". Each set in the limited edition contained a paper certificate of authenticity and an individually numbered tile identifying the set's number within the edition.LEGO withheld the sets numbered 0001 to 0010 from the initial public sale; these ten sets were later sold by LEGO on eBay to raise charity funds. Aside from the set numbers and sales history, there is no distinction between these 10 sets and any others in the ""Limited Edition"".For the general edition release, which followed the sellout of the limited edition, see set 10020-1.

Identical to 10152-1 except for ""2005 Edition"" on the box cover. Due to use of a newer stock of Maersk Blue ABS pellets (funded by Maersk), the shade of Maersk Blue in this version may vary from all previous Maersk sets including 10152-1. Original LEGO plans were a Dark Blue or Dark Green re-color of the 2004 version (never produced).For the 2004 version, which is identical in all respect except packaging and using a older Maersk Blue ABS supply, see set 10152-1.

This version was sold in a square box (rather than the later rectangular design) with original ""Creator Expert"" branding. This version included a front and rear windscreen element (part 2694) which many found poorly presented the iconic windscreens of the MINI Cooper Mark VII upon which this model is based. Reacting to these concerns, LEGO altered the building instructions in December 2014 and repositioned the two windscreens further into the body of the car. A more robust solution was found in mid-2015 with the creation of a new part (24607). This replacement part can be requested from LEGO Customer Service for those who own the initial version. Remember to add these replacement parts to your loose part inventory on Rebrickable since they are not included in this set's inventory!Beginning in July 2015, LEGO altered this set's packaging and included the more accurate windscreens in the box contents.

It appears LEGO redesigned this set after some copies had already been sent to stores, thus two different inventories are known to exist. The errors relate to the engine (build steps 28 to 31, and 50).
Inventory 1 is the earlier version
Inventory 2 is the updated version
When adding this set to your collection please check which inventory is correct.

VIP members were also able to obtain this set as a gift with purchases exceeding $85 / £85 / 85€ / 2215 Kč / 635 kr. / 27775 Ft / 860 kr / 375 zł / 95 CHF / 915 kr beginning on September 6, 2021. This promotion ended on  September 8, 2021 in North America and September 12, 2021 in Europe and the United Kingdom (both while supplies lasted). This set was originally developed to commemorate Children's Day and original promotional images show a corresponding tile. Shipping invoices accordingly refer to the set as for ""C-Day"". During production, a decision was made to replace this tile with one saying ""LEG GODT"" (Danish for ""Play Well""). This was likely due to the inconsistency of observation dates of Children's Day around the world and in acceptance of global supply chain disruptions during 2021.Packaged in a pressure-sealed plastic bag inserted behind the building instructions into a open-fronted cardboard box.While the set number is the official one on LEGO shipping invoices and promotional materials, the set has been seen with the numbers 6373620, 6373621 and 9363621 as the set number on the building instructions depending on the region of release. Additionally, various LEGO regional sites and printed materials have referred to this as set 5006748.

The inventory of this set is based on an image from a 1996 LEGO Direct catalog. The exact year of release is uncertain and may be older than the catalog year.  The set’s inventory appears to be identical to set 5138-1 from 1994 but uses the same set number as a different “Castle Accessories” set (5135-1) from 1995. It remains unknown if this catalog entry was an error or if the 1994 set was rereleased under a different number. If you own this set or can provide additional information, please submit a Change Request.

Also, the inventories are not yet complete or confirmed. Apologies for the inconvenience.This is one of the three sets (together with 700.2-1 and 700.3-1) that started the LEGO history in 1949.This original Automatic Binding Bricks (ABB) version was released in Denmark in 1949 and in Sweden in 1950. This is a five-color version with slotted bricks, doors and windows, and two additional art cards (not inventoried).In 1951 the number of 2x2 slotted bricks is reduced, and a green thin 10x20 baseplate is added (set 700.1-2).In 1952 the number of colors is reduced to 4 as the blue slotted bricks disappeared (set 700.1-3).In 1953 the slotted Automatic Binding Bricks were replaced by hollow Mursten bricks (set 700.1-4).

""The 1970's are regarded by many LEGO fans as an outstanding decade for LEGO trains and the Western Train from 1976 is seen as a vintage model. Based on the design of classic 19th century locomotives, the engine included details such as a smokestack, water boiler and move-able drive shafts. The set included two carriages, three identical cowboy figures and a single black horse built from LEGO bricks. It is believed that this model was the inspiration for the Western locomotives that appeared in the LEGOLAND Park shortly after.""-- from the employee gift re-creation (set 4002016-1-s2) building instructions

Updated boxart depicts the new design and part count while some of the individual set images still reflect the older design.For the original design, see set 75090-2N.B.: Some sets may include the international version of the sticker sheet despite this re-design's primary sale in North American markets.

Controversy in the LEGO fan community over designating this playset as part of the Ultimate Collector Series resulted in LEGO creating the new designation of Master Builder Series. At various points in time, LEGO has included this set in both series.There seems to be an error in the instruction for sticker numbers to be placed in the following:Page 21: step 10, sticker 19 & 20 should be sticker 20 & 21 respectively.Page 86: step 15, sticker 18 should be sticker 19.Page 100: step 43, sticker 17 should be sticker 18.

According to Bricks&Pieces on LEGO.com, this set comes with a Light Bluish Grey 3069bpr0307. But both the Building Instructions and physical conformation states the set has a Dark Bluish Grey 3069bpr0090 instead. Maybe there will be an update in later releases when the stock of the 3069bpr0090 runs out? Please let us know if you find a 3069bpr0307 in your copy of the set.

This set comes with five different license plates to recreate the car’s primary appearances in four different James Bond films:
Goldfinger - BMT 216A / 4711-EA-62 / LU 6789
GoldenEye - BMT 214A
Skyfall - BMT 216A
No Time To Die - A 4269 00
The car also made smaller appearances in Thunderball (BMT 216A), Tomorrow Never Dies (BMT 214A) and Spectre (A 4269 00). An expected cameo in The World Is Not Enough (BMT 214A) was deleted before the film released and only an outline of the car appears in that film. A left hand drive version of the car appeared in Casino Royale (56526). The plate for this version is not included in this set.

Based loosely on the ""MB Trac"" commercial tractors of the era (without any licensing connecting this model to a specific manufacturer), this set was sold in Canada and the United States under the name ""Harvester"" and under the name ""Tractor"" in the rest of the world.Later copies of this set (sold beginning in 1982 or 1983) replaced some parts with newer mould versions and redesigned a weak joint in the driveshaft. These changes resulted in the part inventory being reduced by 2 parts.The set's building instructions include detailed instructions for the main tractor body along with two alternative instructions for a plow or a harrow as the rear attachment (there are only sufficient parts included to build one of these attachments at a time). Additionally, the instructions include:* Detailed instructions for an off-road racing vehicle B-Model* Pictorial instructions for motorizing the tractor using either the European set 870-1 or the North American set 960-1* Detailed instructions for building three additional rear attachment options using parts from set 8710-1* Pictorial instructions for building two additional B-Models - a Dune Buggy or a Beach Bicycle

Available exclusively via an series of 41 online raffles conducted during the online DC FanDome event held on August 22 and August 23, 2020. Between 30 and 40 sets were allotted as prizes for each of the raffles along with one additional set awarded as part of a grand prize raffle open to all raffle entrants. This resulted in a total of 1,496 sets being available via this method.

Available for purchase by attendees of FAN EXPO Canada held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between September 3 and September 6, 2015.Sets were sealed with an individually numbered sticker which presented the number on either side of the box. There is a strong possibility that additional sets were distributed internally by the LEGO Group, Disney, LucasFilm or the event organizers. It is unknown if these internally distributed sets have a set number sticker applied. The total production run (both publically and internally distributed) is believed to have been between 800 and 900 sets. For the identically constructed version, featuring C-3PO instead of R2-D2 and relevant event markings on the packaging, sold at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim (2015),  see set CELEB2015-1.N.B.: While the boxart depicts this set including 178 parts, this is likely an error that failed to account for the R2-D2 minifigure using one additional part than the C-3PO minifigure.
